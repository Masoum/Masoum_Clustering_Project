# Diabetes Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores dataset of diabetic patient encounters. The goal is to analyze patient demographics, clinical factors, and readmission patterns by applying clustering techniques. This analysis helps potentially guiding targeted interventions and improving patient care.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes multiple variables grouped into three main categories:

- **Identifiers:**  
  - `encounter_id`: Unique identifier for each encounter.  
  - `patient_nbr`: Unique identifier for each patient.

- **Demographic and Clinical Features:**  
  - **Demographics:** `race`, `gender`, `age` (grouped in intervals), and `weight`.  
  - **Hospitalization Details:** Variables such as `admission_type_id`, `discharge_disposition_id`, `admission_source_id`, and `time_in_hospital`.  
  - **Clinical Procedures and Tests:** `num_lab_procedures`, `num_procedures`, `num_medications`, `number_outpatient`, `number_emergency`, and `number_inpatient`.  
  - **Diagnostic Information:** Primary and secondary diagnoses (`diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3`) and `number_diagnoses`.  
  - **Lab Results and Medications:** Variables like `max_glu_serum`, `A1Cresult`, and several medication-related features that indicate if a drug was prescribed or if there was a change in dosage.

- **Target Variable:**  
  - `readmitted`: Indicates the patientâ€™s readmission status with values such as `<30` (readmitted within 30 days), `>30`, and `No`.

## Data Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing entries were addressed based on the variableâ€™s importance and distribution.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical variables were encoded by ordinalEncoder
- **Normalization:** Continuous variables were scaled by StandardScaler

## Clustering Analysis

Two types of unsupervised clustering (K-means Model and DBScan Model) was applied to the dataset and has been compared by the results.

### Summary of Clustering Results

The clustering analysis produced the following clusters:

## Patient Cluster Characteristics

Based on the clustering results, here are some high-level observations on the patient characteristics in each cluster:

- **Cluster 0:**  
  - **Demographics:** Mostly Caucasian with a mix of genders.  
  - **Age & Weight:** Patients aged between ~50â€“80, commonly with weight in the [75â€“100) range 
  - **Hospital Stay:** Moderate length of stay (3â€“6 days) with a low readmission rate

- **Cluster 1:**  
  - **Demographics:** Mostly Caucasian with some patients in their 20s 
  - **Hospital Stay:** Around 1â€“12 days

- **Cluster 2 & 3:**  
  - **Demographics:** Older patients with higher readmission rates (up to 27â€“33%)  
  - **Clinical Notes:** These clusters may require closer follow-up 

- **Cluster 4:**  
  - **Demographics:** Older population with varied weight ranges and moderate hospital stays.  
  - **Observations:** Shows a balanced mix of lab and procedural counts.

3 **Clusters 5â€“15:**  
  - **Variations:**is a bit different ication counts) with readmission rates ranging from as low as 0% (Cluster 10) to 50% (Cluster 7).  
  - **Note:** Some clusters are very small (e.g., Cluster 3, Cluster 7) and might rst ou| Cluster | Dominant Race / Gender         | Typical Age Range       | Typical Weight Range   | Hospital Stay (Days) | Readmission Rate | Additional Observations                                          |

## Overview

This project explores dataset of diabetic patient encounters. The goal is to analyze patient demographics, clinical factors, and readmission patterns by applying clustering techniques. This analysis helps potentially guiding targeted interventions and improving patient care.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes multiple variables grouped into three main categories:

- **Identifiers:**  
  - `encounter_id`: Unique identifier for each encounter.  
  - `patient_nbr`: Unique identifier for each patient.

- **Demographic and Clinical Features:**  
  - **Demographics:** `race`, `gender`, `age` (grouped in intervals), and `weight`.  
  - **Hospitalization Details:** Variables such as `admission_type_id`, `discharge_disposition_id`, `admission_source_id`, and `time_in_hospital`.  
  - **Clinical Procedures and Tests:** `num_lab_procedures`, `num_procedures`, `num_medications`, `number_outpatient`, `number_emergency`, and `number_inpatient`.  
  - **Diagnostic Information:** Primary and secondary diagnoses (`diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3`) and `number_diagnoses`.  
  - **Lab Results and Medications:** Variables like `max_glu_serum`, `A1Cresult`, and several medication-related features that indicate if a drug was prescribed or if there was a change in dosage.

- **Target Variable:**  
  - `readmitted`: Indicates the patientâ€™s readmission status with values such as `<30` (readmitted within 30 days), `>30`, and `No`.

## Data Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing entries were addressed based on the variableâ€™s importance and distribution.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical variables were encoded by ordinalEncoder
- **Normalization:** Continuous variables were scaled by StandardScaler

## Clustering Analysis

Two types of unsupervised clustering (K-means Model and DBScan Model) was applied to the dataset and has been compared by the results.

### Summary of Clustering Results

The clustering analysis produced the following clusters:

| Cluster | Size | <30 Day Readmissions | Readmission Rate |

## Patient Cluster Characteristics

Based on the clustering results, here are some high-level observations on the patient characteristics in each cluster:

- **Cluster 0:**  
  - **Demographics:** Mostly Caucasian with a mix of genders.  
  - **Age & Weight:** Patients aged between ~50â€“80, commonly with weight in the [75â€“100) range 
  - **Hospital Stay:** Moderate length of stay (3â€“6 days) with a low readmission rate

- **Cluster 1:**  
  - **Demographics:** Mostly Caucasian with some patients in their 20s 
  - **Hospital Stay:** Around 1â€“12 days

- **Cluster 2 & 3:**  
  - **Demographics:** Older patients with higher readmission rates (up to 27â€“33%)  
  - **Clinical Notes:** These clusters may require closer follow-up 

- **Cluster 4:**  
  - **Demographics:** Older population with varied weight ranges and moderate hospital stays.  
  - **Observations:** Shows a balanced mix of lab and procedural counts.

- **Clusters 5â€“13:**  
  - **Variations:** These clusters is a bit different with readmission rates ranging from as low as 0% (Cluster 10) to 50% (Cluster 7).  
  - **Note:** Some clusters are very small (e.g., Cluster 3, Cluster 7) and might represent outliers.
